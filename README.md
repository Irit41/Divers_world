# Divers worldðŸ¤¿
 The world of divers is a world full of experiences, challenges and beautiful landscapes, but accompanied by administration and physical obstacles. First, every diver should be equipped with a diving log, so that he can receive services from diving clubs throughout the country and the world. The diary must be kept well, in particular due to its tendency to get wet or get lost. Second, the dives are usually in pairs, and it is not easy to find a partner. Third, each dive requires a lot of equipment that is not always available to the diver during the dive.

 <h4>ðŸ“Œ The mission :<h4/>
Establish an information system that will assist divers in everything required to manage their dives. Build this through an interface (Console Application) that simulates the various processes required in the system.
